# sorting_algorithm
Challange was write own script on sorting lenght of strings in text file.

First script use build-in python function for sorting.

Second script use quicksort function I had to write above it. I used two lists for comparison. The first list (a_list) contains words from a text file, and the second (b_list) uses the length of those words that are sorted and create a third list (c_list) when compared first and second list.

It was pretty fun to replicate build-in function(, but still useless. At last I learned sorting algorithms).
